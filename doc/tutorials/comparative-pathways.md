---

## 📊 Step 3: Strategic Pathway Selection

### Choose Pathways for Comparison

**Navigate to "Pathway Comparison" tab**:

**🎯 Strategic pathway selection for treatment response**:

1. **Immune-related pathways**:
   - **Inflammation**: Expected to increase post-immunotherapy
   - **Apoptosis**: May increase in responding tumors
   - **Hypoxia**: May decrease with improved perfusion

2. **Cancer progression pathways**:
   - **Proliferation**: Should decrease in responding patients
   - **Invasion**: May decrease with effective treatment
   - **Metastasis**: Should be reduced post-treatment

3. **Resistance pathways**:
   - **Stemness**: May increase in resistant cells
   - **EMT**: Often associated with therapy resistance
   - **Quiescence**: Escape mechanism from therapy

**Select for analysis**: Inflammation, Apoptosis, Proliferation, Stemness, EMT

### Calculate Multiple Pathways

## 🧬 Step 4: Pathway Correlation Analysis

### Interpret Correlation Matrix

**📊 Correlation matrix interpretation**:

**Expected correlations in treatment context**:
- **Stemness ↔ EMT**: Positive correlation (r = 0.6-0.8)
  - *Biological meaning*: Both resistance mechanisms
- **Proliferation ↔ Apoptosis**: Negative correlation (r = -0.4)
  - *Biological meaning*: Opposing cellular fates
- **Inflammation ↔ Apoptosis**: Positive correlation (r = 0.3-0.5)
  - *Biological meaning*: Immune-mediated cell death

**🔍 Treatment-specific patterns**:
- **Pre-treatment**: Strong stemness-EMT correlation
- **Post-treatment**: Stronger inflammation-apoptosis correlation
- **Responders**: Weaker stemness-proliferation correlation
- **Non-responders**: Maintained resistance pathway correlations

### Pathway Network Analysis

## 📈 Step 5: Condition-Specific Pathway Analysis

### Compare Pathways by Treatment Status

**📊 Pathway by Cluster Analysis**:

**Expected pre vs post-treatment patterns**:

**Inflammation Pathway**:
- **Pre-treatment**: Low across most clusters
- **Post-treatment**: Elevated in immune and tumor clusters
- **Interpretation**: Successful immune activation

**Apoptosis Pathway**:
- **Pre-treatment**: Low in tumor clusters
- **Post-treatment**: Increased in responding tumor clusters  
- **Interpretation**: Therapy-induced cell death

**Proliferation Pathway**:
- **Pre-treatment**: High in aggressive tumor clusters

## 🎯 Step 6: Response-Based Stratification

### Compare Responders vs Non-Responders

**Stratify analysis by clinical response**:

**📊 Responder-specific pathway patterns**:

## 🔬 Step 7: Temporal Analysis (Paired Samples)

### Patient-Level Trajectory Analysis

**📊 Individual patient responses**:

**Patient PT01 (Strong Responder)**:
- **Inflammation**: 0.2 → 2.8 (+14-fold)
- **Apoptosis**: 0.5 → 1.9 (+3.8-fold)
- **Proliferation**: 2.1 → 0.8 (-2.6-fold)
- **Pattern**: Classic response profile

## 📊 Step 8: Advanced Statistical Analysis

### Multi-way Comparison

**📈 Complex comparison design**:
- **Factor 1**: Treatment (Pre vs Post)
- **Factor 2**: Response (Responder vs Non-responder)
- **Interaction**: Treatment × Response effects

**Statistical model results**:

```
Two-way ANOVA Results:
                    F-value    p-value    Effect Size
Treatment Effect:   45.2       <0.001     Large (η² = 0.15)
Response Effect:    23.7       <0.001     Medium (η² = 0.08)
Interaction:        12.1       <0.01      Small (η² = 0.04)
```

**🔍 Interpretation**:
- **Treatment effect**: Strong overall treatment impact
- **Response effect**: Baseline differences between responder groups
- **Interaction**: Response depends on baseline characteristics

### Multiple Testing Correction

**📊 Adjusted p-values (Benjamini-Hochberg)**:

```
Pathway          Raw p-value    Adjusted p-value    Significant
Inflammation     <0.001         <0.001              ***
Apoptosis        0.003          0.008               **
Proliferation    0.021          0.035               *
Invasion         0.067          0.084               ns
Stemness         0.089          0.089               ns
```

**Result**: 3/5 pathways remain significant after correction

## 🎯 Step 9: Clinical Biomarker Development

### Pathway-Based Signatures

**🧬 Response prediction signature**:

**Inflammation-Apoptosis Ratio (IAR)**:
```
IAR = log2(Inflammation Score / Apoptosis Score)

Baseline IAR:
- Responders: -0.8 ± 0.3
- Non-responders: -1.4 ± 0.2
- AUC = 0.76 (good discrimination)

Post-treatment IAR:
- Responders: +0.9 ± 0.4  
- Non-responders: -0.2 ± 0.3
- AUC = 0.95 (excellent discrimination)
```

**Resistance Risk Score (RRS)**:
```
RRS = (Stemness + EMT) - (Inflammation + Apoptosis)

High Risk (RRS > 1.0): 
- 90% probability of non-response
- Enriched for stemness/EMT pathways

Low Risk (RRS < -1.0):
- 85% probability of response  
- Strong immune activation
```

### Pathway Dynamics Score

**📊 Treatment Response Trajectory**:
```
Response Velocity = Δ(Inflammation + Apoptosis) - Δ(Stemness + EMT)

Rapid Responders (Velocity > 2.0):
- Quick inflammation increase
- Rapid proliferation decrease
- Early apoptosis activation

Slow Responders (Velocity 0.5-2.0):
- Gradual pathway changes
- Mixed response patterns
- May need treatment intensification

Non-Responders (Velocity < 0.5):
- Minimal beneficial changes
- Maintained resistance pathways
- Consider alternative therapies
```

```
Comparative pathway analysis was performed using MASIH to assess treatment-induced 
functional state changes. CancerSEA pathway scores were calculated for inflammation, 
apoptosis, proliferation, stemness, and EMT pathways in pre- and post-treatment 
samples from 6 patients. Statistical comparisons used two-way ANOVA with factors 
for treatment status and clinical response, followed by Benjamini-Hochberg multiple 
testing correction. Pathway correlation analysis identified co-regulated functional 
modules. Response prediction signatures were developed using pathway score ratios 
and validated using area under the ROC curve analysis...
